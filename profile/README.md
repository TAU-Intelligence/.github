- We build safe, intelligent systems that operate reliably in the real world—where unpredictability isn’t a bug, it’s the default.

- Founded by researchers and engineers with deep roots in robotics, AI, and control theory, TAU Intelligence bridges the gap between academic innovation and industry-grade deployment. From custom safety-critical controllers to intelligent simulation environments, we help companies design, verify, and deploy autonomous systems that don’t just work in theory—they work in reality.

- Whether you’re a robotics startup building the next generation of autonomous machines, or an industrial automation team tackling high-risk, high-complexity tasks, our mission is the same: **To make your autonomy smarter, safer, and shockproof.**

**Trusted and Safe intelligence is not a luxury. It’s the future. And we’re building it.**
